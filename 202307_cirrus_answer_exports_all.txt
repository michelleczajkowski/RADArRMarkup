 self-control and social skills. Today’s kids play games with teams of other kids, who may be friends from school or strangers from across the planet, people whose real names they will never know but whom they learn to care about and trust. And lastly, recent research reveals a Goldilocks effect. One to two hours of (day) (6)____
 screen time (including WhatsApp, movies and video games) are optimal for teens’ “mental wellbeing,” that is to say, better than either no screen time or more than three or four hours a day. A new direction in gaming research is to use the inherent appeal of the games – the thing that makes them so (attract) (7)____
 – to help to improve children’s mental health. The Playnice Institute develops and tests games that are potent at counteracting childhood anxiety, the most serious (psychology) (8)____
 problem facing US families. Rather than try to drag (depression) (9)____

 kids to control their emotions and build self-confidence, both on the screen and in what we like to call real life.

Loneliness, a National Crisis

To replace some text with a blank field, highlight the text and click create blank.
Imagine there was a virus you’d never heard of which increased the likelihood of mortality by 26%, or a condition which had a death rate comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. A national health crisis would be declared and it would be very difficult to  (1)____
the peace. This public health crisis, which leaves its victims more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s and other dementias, has a name: loneliness.

As currently seems to be the (2)____
, more than 2 million adults suffer from chronic loneliness, and  (3)____
 its most severe form is more prevalent among Britain’s oldest citizens, younger adults (4)____
 report loneliness more than any other age group.

A desire for social connection is (5)____
 hardwired into our psychology, and so being deprived of it has devastating mental and physical consequences. Yet we live in a society which has become ever more fragmented and atomised. This coincides with the decline of Britain’s industrial era though this period was, (6)____
 a significant extent, male-dominated. The work was also often physically damaging, whole communities were based around mines, docks and factories. Call centres, supermarkets, office blocks and zero-hours work do not (7)____
  the same social connections.

(8)____
, in back in those days the problem was often the opposite of loneliness: claustrophobia, of everyone knowing what everyone else was up to. Jobs have become less secure and staff turnover has increased while union membership has gone down, weakening workplace. Similar trends can be observed when it comes to housing. While more than three-quarters of us think it would be better if we knew our neighbours, 73% of us don’t even know their names. When (9)____
 that data, researchers also noted that more and more of us live alone, and (10)____
 some may consider the 28% rise in the numbers working from home as liberating, it is undoubtedly isolating too. These trends are similar(11)____
 the ones that are observed in northern and western Europe.

The social spaces that (12)____
 a lot of information on the reasons why we congregate and connect are dying. In the 1970s, there were more than 4,000 working men’s clubs; just 1,300 remain. A quarter of Britain’s pubs have closed since the beginning of the century. Nightlife is withering: in 2018 alone, the number of British nightclubs fell by a fifth. The decade-long fall in young people’s living standards has robbed them of their collective spaces: hundreds of youth centres (13)____
 used by teens and twenty-somethings have closed their doors. And almost 800 libraries have been axed in the decade of austerity.

Nonbelievers may welcome the collapse in British religiosity, but the decline in church attendance has meant that the chance to chat each week with other people has vanished.

Is this unravelling of social connections inevitable and irreversible? Maybe. However , all of us need to connect with others, even as society has robbed us of opportunities to do so. An atomised, fragmented society is not simply sad – something to passively mourn – but contributes to a major public health crisis. Loneliness is devastating our mental and physical health and, at its worst, is killing us. Yet thankfully, (14)____
some conditions, loneliness is something we can easily cure. We just need the will.

Some of us are good at successfully communicating thoughts in a clear way.  Others may stumble or struggle to (1)____
their ideas and feelings into words. But (2)____
of the size of our lexicons, all of us humans share the ability to combine two or more words into a new meaning or idea —an ability known (3)____
"compositional syntax." This has long been thought to be unique to Homo sapiens, but biologists have discovered this ability for the first time in another species: the Japanese great tit (Parus minor). This little songbird that may well have just (4)____
that animal communication is a much more complex world than we (5)____
thought. The new findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.
Human language is characterized (6)____
the ability to produce a seemingly endless number of articulations from a fixed number of vocal tools. It’s principally made up of two main parts: phonology and compositional syntax. Phonology combines sounds to make words, and compositional syntax combines words to form more complex expressions.
Other species of birds and monkeys are known to use combinations of sounds, and alter note sequences, but none of the sounds they use have any kind of a (7)____
meaning on their own. Therefore, these examples don't constitute compositional syntax, and are still phonological.
Biologist Toshitaka Suzuki, of the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan, had noticed during his fieldwork that Japanese great tits (Parus minor) were calling to one another with a wide (8)____
of notes, and that they were combining different notes and call types. "I wondered if they may use grammar and syntax for chatting with others, like human speech" he recalls.
Inspired to find out, Suzuki and his colleagues recorded various calls and played them back to birds to see their reaction. They (9)____
on two note types specifically, that they labeled ABC, and D. ABC is a call that great tits use to caution each other about possible predators in the area. When hearing this call, the little songbirds usually scan their surroundings to make sure the coast is clear. D is a call that (10)____
means to “come here.”
When tied together (ABC-D), the two calls combine to form a new complex meaning. Birds that hear it usually come to the (11)____
of the call (D), but scan the area first (ABC) and approach with caution. It’s like saying “come here, but be careful.”
To make sure , (12)____
, that the tits weren’t just responding to two different calls in sequence, Suzuki and his colleagues played an artificial call to the songbirds that reversed the notes to D-ABC. When hearing that flipped syntax, most of the birds did nothing. This indicated that that the combination of ABC-D—in that specific order—holds a very specific meaning.
It’s hard to imagine that other species of birds, or perhaps whales or dolphins that (13)____
heavily on vocal communication, do not also engage in compositional syntax that we just haven’t observed yet. “I expect that compositional syntax may be (14)____
in other animals, too,” says Suzuki.

Last Wednesday, BP’s new boss set out the boldest climate goal of any (1)____
 oil company, pledging that he wanted  to(2)____
 sure that almost all of the carbon emissions from BP operations and the fuel it sells to customers are a thing of the past.

Bernard Looney, who has been the company’s chief executive for just a week, (3)____
 some ambitious goals for what’s 
becoming a real challenge for the oil industry. (15)____
 competitors such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Equinor
 have responded to investor pressure by setting targets for lower emissions, none has promised to zero out all
 emissions from the fossil fuels they pump from the ground. Looney, without detailing how it would be (5)____
, said BP will do that by 2050.

The world’s carbon budget is finite and time is running (6)____
 fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero,” Looney said in a statement.
 “We have got to change — and change (7)____
.” It seems to be the (8)____
 that only Spain’s Repsol, a smaller refiner
 and energy producer, has gone further: It has pledged to phase out all “Scope 3” emissions, which include fuel it buys from
 third parties and sells to consumers.

Looney sounded quite confident, but he (9)____
 an enormous task. The London-based company’s new chief executive didn’t
have detailed answers to questions about how one of the world’s largest oil companies should help (10)____
 the use of fossil fuels;
BP tapped the first fields in Iran in the early 20th century and drilled wildcat wells on the Alaskan frontier more than 60 years ago.

“I appreciate you want more than a vision — you (11)____
 want to see milestones, near-term targets, some ways to measure progress,”
Looney said in a question-and-answer page on BP’s website. “We do not have those for you right now,” but the company will announce 
more measures in September, he said.

Radical change

 BP to survive, the energy transition that will take place (13)____
 time, it will need to make big investments
 in new sources of clean energy, ensure cash keeps flowing from its fossil fuel assets and also funnel
 generous returns to investors.  It’s a tricky balancing act, which, (14)____
 some extent, its closest peer,
 Shell, is already mastering. BP’s commitment to do all this while still boosting free cash flow and
 shareholder returns is “really the key challenge,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said.

Having to compete for food and living space can make for some tense interactions with your roommates. But just imagine thousands—or millions—of individuals spending decades sharing the same dark room. They'd need constant communication to (1)____
the peace.
That seems to be the (2)____
even for Egyptian fruit bats, which live in large colonies and are (3)____
social creatures. Walking into a typical roost can be a noisy experience, but are the bats just making random noises or are they (4)____
talking to each other?
In a study published in Scientific Reports on Thursday, researchers suggest that the noisy bat calls actually do (5)____
a lot of information, including who’s ‘speaking’ and whether the bats in a particular interaction are fighting about food, a mate, or something completely different.
“The vocalizations we (6)____
in this study were all categorized in the past as agonistic calls, that is, aggressive vocalizations emitted during fighting. We now show that there is information in this chaos. We demonstrate that a third individual listening to a fight between two bats can tell who is shouting, what is the context of shouting (e.g., fighting over food or over position or over mating) and even (7)____
some extent who is being shouted at. We now know that the cacophony that we hear when entering a bat cave is far from just noise,” Yossi Yovel, the lead author of the study, told Popular Science in an e-mail.
By recording a group of 22 bats for 3 months straight, Yovel and colleagues were able to figure out which bats were (8)____
in  any conversation and what they were squabbling about. (9)____
, that doesn’t mean that the researchers have identified a bat language, or even the bats’ individual call signs. What they did manage to do is recognize individual bat voices.
“It is similar (10)____
human individual voices. It is not that bats state their name, but that when you examine their voice, you can recognize who is shouting (or calling),” Yovel says. “In fact, in the study, we used algorithms that are (11)____
used for human speech recognition to recognize the individual bats.”
They could also figure out specific noises that related to food, mates, or a need for some space. But this isn’t the start of some kind of (12)____
-species communication.
“We do not find a 'word' that means 'hello' or 'move' or 'eat' in bat communication,” Yovel says. “You could imagine this as something like this: when a bat shouts at another bat for taking its food, the vocalizations will always be higher in pitch than when they are fighting over a position in the cave.”
The next step will be to figure out how bats know to make those noises. Are they born with this manner of "speaking" or do they learn it (13)____
time? Yovel and his colleagues are also looking into vocalizations made outside of the confines of the roost. To (14)____
that data, they are attaching tiny microphones to bats in the field, which is adorable. Maybe someday soon we’ll have an even more detailed answer to that age old question: ‘what does the bat say?’

Romance, psychology and chemicals

Romantic love is overwhelming, irresistible, stormy. It is in control of us more than we are ever in control of it. In one (1)____
 it is a mystery, in another, it is pure simplicity – its course, once started, is predictable and inevitable, and the way it is expressed is more or less uniform across time and space. 

Yet love is not easily understood by science, which is why scientists (2)____
 an enormous task. Sex pheromones, chemicals designed to communicate information about our reproductive availability to others, are often quoted (3)____
 key instruments of attraction. It is a nice idea. But   (4)____
pheromones play an important role in insect communication, there is very little evidence that they even exist in humans.

However, if a chemical can (5)____
attraction outside the body, why not inside it? The neuropeptide oxytocin, often described as a "bonding hormone" and known (6)____
 its role in the production of mother’s milk in mammals, is the leading candidate here. This has been extensively studied, mainly in the prairie field mouse whose monogamy and public (7)____
 of affection make it an ideal model animal.

Blocking oxytocin has a negative effect on the pair bonding that is a surrogate for love, and (8)____
 sure the field mice are more restrained in their emotional expressions. On the other  (15)____
 , too much oxytocin in other, non-monogamous field mouse species lowers their taste for sexual adventure. In humans, though, the effects are much less dramatic – a subtle change in the romantic preference for the familiar over the new. So oxytocin is far from proven to be (10)____
 to love.

Of course, even if we could identify such a substance, any message – chemical or otherwise – needs a receiver. So where is the letterbox of love in the brain? And how is the identity of the “chosen one” communicated, given the fact that it’s not possible (11)____
 a single molecule to encode it?

When romantic love is (12)____
 with imaging of the brain, the areas that “light up” overlap with those supporting reward-seeking and goal-oriented behaviour. But that parts of our brains are (13)____
 on fire by one thing does not tell us much if they are just as excited by a very different, other thing. And the observed patterns of romantic love are, (14)____
 some extent, not that different from those of maternal bonding, or even from the love of one's favourite football team. So we can only conclude that neuroscience is yet to explain this "head over heels" emotion in neural terms.
